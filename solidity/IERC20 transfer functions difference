There are two transfer functions in ERC20.
function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

The transferFrom function is used when one address (usually a spender) wants to transfer tokens on behalf of another address (the token owner). 
In order to use transferFrom, the token owner must have approved the spender to transfer up to a certain amount of tokens.
Example of transferFrom Usage
Let’s say Alice owns 100 tokens, and she wants to allow Bob to spend 50 of those tokens on her behalf. The flow would look like this:
Alice calls approve(Bob, 50) on the token contract, allowing Bob to spend 50 of her tokens.
Bob calls transferFrom(Alice, Charlie, 50), transferring 50 tokens from Alice's account to Charlie’s account.

If it is the owner of the tokens to spend the tokens, it is enough to use transfer function to transfer token to
